# NEXT AGENT TASK

## Current state (2026-10-30T03:20:53Z)

- Gate status: **NOT eligible yet** (bound `2026-10-30T22:20:37.246523+00:00`, current time `2026-10-30T03:20:41.627096+00:00`). Confirmed via offline check: `{'eligible': False, 'bound': '2026-10-30T22:20:37.246523+00:00', 'now': '2026-10-30T03:20:41.627096+00:00', 'reason': 'the 24 h refresh bound 2026-10-30T22:20:37.246523+00:00 has not elapsed yet'}` (~19h 00m remaining). No provider calls.
- Action taken (this cycle): Offline gate check re-run. Not eligible. Single wakeup `wku_18aced59b001MSZ2grKNqiS53v` already set due `2026-10-30T22:25:00Z` (after bound). No provider calls. No code changes. Working tree clean.
- Previous cycle state preserved: snapshot `universe/mcap_snapshot_20261029_222037.json`, `eligible_unseen_below_floor_count = 0`, state `AWAITING_NEW_ELIGIBLE_CANDIDATES`, `next_eligible_refresh_at = 2026-10-30T22:20:37.246523+00:00`. Universe unchanged (N=275).
- Wakeup discipline: Single wakeup only; no polling before bound.

## Grid reconciliation (unchanged)

Both grids re-read from disk and independently verified complete — no missing, blocked, or unverified cells:

| Run | Symbols | Pairs | Cells | Progress | Mean net PF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `results/20261019_135940_grid` (parent baseline) | 275 | 66 | 18,150 | `all_symbols_processed=true`, `next_cell=null`, `stopped=false`, 0 blocked | 0.4987 |
| `results/20261022_134500_grid` (child `C_stricter_trend`) | 275 | 66 | 18,150 | `all_symbols_processed=true`, `next_cell=null`, `stopped=false`, 0 blocked | 0.4987 |
| `results/20261021_172619_grid` (child `C_min_risk_atr`) | 275 | 66 | 18,150 | `all_symbols_processed=true`, `next_cell=null`, `stopped=false`, 0 blocked | 0.7264 |

- `results/mutations.json` records both children as `NOT_PROMOTED` with full decision legs. Baseline has 0 credible candidates; 37 cells with net PF > 1 all rejected.

## Measurable next task

At/after `2026-10-30T22:20:37.246523+00:00` (24h after the pass at ~22:20:37Z), re-run the offline gate check:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -c "import json; from scripts.refresh_gate import gate_status; print(gate_status(json.load(open('universe/last_scan.json'))))"
```

If still not eligible, stop and re-set a single wakeup just after the bound (do **NOT** call the provider). If eligible, run exactly one 20-page pass `PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/fetch_mcap_snapshot.py --pages 20`, recompute the expansion floor, and inspect the band strictly below the floor for `eligible_unseen_below_floor_count`. If 0, record the pass, set `next_eligible_refresh_at`, re-set the wakeup just after the new bound, and stop. If >0, expand per PROMPT.md §2.1 and run the full 66-pair grid on each new symbol via `scripts/run_grid.py`, then re-aggregate.

## Constraints (unchanged)

Historical research only; no orders/live/paper trading; no provider before bound; 1 pass max/cycle; do not fetch new candle data; do not modify baseline grid/costs/fills/entry-exit semantics; do not trigger/cancel/rerun GitHub Actions or edit workflows; single wakeup only; keep strict confirmatory separate from exploratory.
